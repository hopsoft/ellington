# Use ellington to model this process
#
# 0 - Pick any three digits number with decreasing digits (432 or 875) [This will be implicit, thus step #0]
# 1 - reverse the number you wrote in step #0
# 2 - Subtract the number obtained in step #1 from the number you wrote in step #0
# 3 - Reverse the number obtained in step #2
# 4 - Add the numbers found in step #2 and step #3
#
# You will get a result of 1089
